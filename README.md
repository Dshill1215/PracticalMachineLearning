You can find both the RMD files and HTML files uploaded as asked by the assignment.  To upload the HTML, Github required the file size to be smaller so it is attached as a zip file.  Simply unzip and view it in the browser to see the analysis.  So that fulfills all the requirements of the assignment.
To make it easier and save time for you, I have also included another link here if you'd like to see the same analysis:
